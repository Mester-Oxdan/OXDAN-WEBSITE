What Does Oxdan Dragon? || !REMEMBER! Author don't care and he is not responsible for your deals in this console. This console was created for the purpose of coding knowledge and testing security. You can find code of this console on Author github (https://github.com/Mester-Oxdan). This console has so many advantages for example 1) so many commands! This console has 9 classes of different command types: MAINS, HACKER_STUFFS, PICTURES, ACCOUNTS, SERIOUS, GAMES, OWNS, PRANKS and ELSES. Author advice is to test all these utilities just on your devices or virtual machines. If you find some bugs or errors please report them on Author Email (bogerter4521de@gmail.com). It will be better if you will take some pictures or videos of the problem. Please don't send some bullsh*t on the Author email. Author respects you and trusts in your help. Author wants to make this console perfect with your help. If you have any ideas it also can be helpful! Author will check email 1 time per week. Also your name could be on the leaders board in the lists section. The difference between OXDAN DRAGON C/C++ and OXDAN DRAGON PYTHON is almost nothing because they have the same futures. When Python was mostly used in guis, C/C++ was mostly used for more complex stuff like system engine, etc. This console was made for Windows! Author still didn't create this console for linux, phones and other systems. Author began developing this console for the purpose of studying coding in 2023, but then it eventually became a project where Author created his first program.
