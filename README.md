(About):

!REMEMBER! Author don't care and he is not responsible for your deals in this console. This console was created for learning programing and testing security. You

can find code of this console on Author github (https://github.com/Mester-Oxdan). This console has so many advantages for example 1) so many

commands! This console has 9 classes of different command types: MAINS, HACKER_STUFFS, PICTURES, ACCOUNTS, SERIOUS, GAMES, OWNS, PRANKS

and ELSES. Author advises testing all these utilities just on your devices. If you find some bugs or errors please let Author know. You can send a message on Author

email (bogerter4521de@gmail.com). It will be better if you will take some pictures or videos of the problem. Please don't send some bullshit on the Author email.

Because Author respects you and trusts in your help. Author just wants to make this console perfect with your help. If you have ideas it can also be helpful

for Author. Author will check email 1 time per week. Also your name could be on the leaders board in the lists section. Difference between OXDAN DRAGON C/C++

and OXDAN DRAGON PYTHON is almost the same but Python better because for Author was easier programing on Python than on C/C++, so Python likely have

little bit more commands than C/C++. This console was made for Windows! Author still didn't create this console for linux, phones and other systems. Author started

creating this console only because of studying coding in 2023, but then it became a project where Author created his first program. Thanks!

<b>If you will need parts of this project or anything about it, you must run/have:</b>

make sure vendor folder in resources folder, composor json files must be there too.

Dont forget to edit env file for environment veriables otherwise all php wouldn't work. 😀
